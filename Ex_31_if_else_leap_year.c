/*
A year is considered a leap year if:

It is divisible by 4.
However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.
Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not, outputs the result in a specific format, and handles invalid years as well.

Input Format

A single integer Y representing the year.
Constraints

−10^5 ≤ Y ≤ 10^5

Output Format

Print "The given year [Y] is Invalid year." if the year is invalid.
Print "Yes, [Y] is a leap year." if the year is a leap year.
Print "No, [Y] is not a leap year." otherwise.
Sample Input 0

2024
Sample Output 0

Yes, 2024 is a leap year.
Sample Input 1

2001
Sample Output 1

No, 2001 is not a leap year.
Sample Input 2

-234
Sample Output 2

The given year -234 is Invalid year.
